# Joyjet tech interview

Come and help us build game changing apps and platforms for international clients

## Guidelines

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit at the very least at the end of each level

## What we expect

- clean code
- tests
- comments when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec
- a simple way to run the code and the tests

## Acknowledgements

This test is shamelessly inspired by the drivy tech interview, which a client found really great and which we then copied too :)
