- If you are responding to a backend position, please solve the levels inside backend in ascending order;
- Otherwise, you can use the appropriate folders for iOS, Android or front end;
- Feel free to complete tests for other platforms for extra brownie points;
- Commit at the very least at the end of each level.

## What we expect

- Clean code;
- Tests;
- Comments when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec;
- A simple way to run the code and the tests.

## Acknowledgements

The Android, iOS, webdesign and frontend tests were completely designed by us, while the backend tests were shamesly ~~inspired~~ copied from the tests at one of our clients interview process, which our client had already found to be really great at another client. :)
