## Hints

- Indented code is a pleasure to look at.
- Never use images wider than 1920px (unless this is really necessary or specified);
- Remember : [image compression](https://tinypng.com/) is important\!
- Effects and animations will receive bonus points;
- Sticky navigation bar (blue stripe on the middle) should be fixed on top after scrolling on page.
